## Datasets

The datasets in this folder have been cleaned and parsed to work with the [Scratch Viz](http://jay-oh-en.github.io/scratch-viz/index.html) extension.

### Cars

> There are 398 observations on the following 8 variables: MPG (miles per gallon), # cylinders, engine displacement (cu. inches), horsepower, vehicle weight (lbs.), time to accelerate from O to 60 mph (sec.), model year (modulo 100), and origin of car (1. American, 2. European, 3. Japanese). These data appear on seven pages. Also provided are the car labels (types) in the same order as the 8 variables on seven separate pages. Missing data values are marked by series of question marks.

### Scratch Statistics

[http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scratch_Statistics](http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scratch_Statistics)

> The Scratch 2.0 statistics page was released on October 15, 2013[1] and displays a wide variety of stats solely related to Scratch. It shows statistics from the beginning of Scratch in May 2007 to present-day. There are a total of seven statistic trends, or charts, displayed on the page. One new feature is the ability to click or rollover on a specific point on the graph and see the values of the data in that particular point or time. The data taken in at account creation goes solely towards statistics.

### Nasa

> Data from NASA's Grace satellites show that the land ice sheets in both Antarctica and Greenland are losing mass. The continent of Antarctica has been losing about 134 billion metric tons of ice per year since 2002, while the Greenland ice sheet has been losing an estimated 287 billion metric tons per year.

### Trees

> List of Department of Public works maintained street trees including: Planting date, species, and location.

The original data has been aggregated and cleaned to where each row represents a given day and the number of trees planted on that day.

### Climate

> The columns are the modeled estimates that each climate factor contributes to the overall temperature. Each factor was simulated five times, with different initial conditions; each slide here shows the average of five runs. GISS researchers laid out their historical simulations in detail last year in this article. The modeled years 1850-1879 from the Phase-5 "historical" experiment are not shown because the observed data begins in 1880.
